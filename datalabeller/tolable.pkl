Residents had been accused of not paying for electricity.  Apparently deciding that the nine month old was capable of - and had - taken part in the alleged stone throwing, Sub-Inspector Kashif Ahmed decided to arrest the child. Baby Muhammad is however currently expected back in court on 12 April - although the judge apparently noted the absurd nature of the charge, he does not have the powers to dismiss the case against him.is it possible huyu mtoi anaweza kuwa alikuwa involved ?'

aS'Interesting conspiracy theory had to share this!!\nSubject: Fw: Israel\'s view of the missing MH370\n\nThe story goes like this:\nThe Americans are withdrawing from Afghanistan; one of their command and control systems (used for controlling pilotless drones) was hijacked by the Taliban when an American transport convoy was moving down from one of the hill-top bases. The Taliban ambushed the convoy and killed 2 American Seal personnel, seized the equipment/weapons, including the command and control system which weighed about 20 tons and packed into 6 crates. This happened about a month ago in Feb 2014.\nWhat the Taliban wants is money. They want to sell the system to the Russians or the Chinese. The Russians are too busy in Ukraine. The Chinese are hungry for the system\'s technology. Just imagine if the Chinese master the technology behind the command and control system, all the American drones will become useless. So the Chinese sent 8 top defense scientists to check the system and agreed to pay millions for it.\nSometime in early Mar 2014 the 8 scientists and the 6 crates made their way to Malaysia thinking that it was the best covert way to avoid detection. The cargo was then kept in the Embassy under diplomatic protection. Meanwhile the Americans have engaged the assistance of Israeli intelligence and together they are determined to intercept and recapture the cargo.\nThe Chinese calculated that it would be safer to transport it via civilian aircraft so as to avoid suspicion. After all the direct flight from KL to Beijing takes only 4 and half hours and the Americans will not hijack or harm a civilian airliner. So MH370 is the perfect carrier.\nThere were 5 American and Israeli agents onboard who were familiar with Boeing aircraft operation. The 2 "Iranians" with stolen passports could be among them.\nWhen MH370 was about to leave Malaysian air space and report in to Vietnamese air control an American AWAC jammed their signal, disabled the pilot control system and switched over to remote control mode. That was when the plane lost altitude momentarily.\nHow the AWAC can do it ? Remember 911 incident ? After the 911 incident all Boeing aircraft (and possibly all Airbus) are installed with a remote control system to counter terrorist hijacking. Since then all Boeing aircraft can be remote controlled by a ground control tower. The same remote control system used to control the pilotless spy aircraft and drones.\nThe 5 American/Israeli agents soon took over the plane, switched off the transponder and other communication systems, changed course and flew westwards. They dared not fly east to Philippines or Guam because the whole South China Sea air space was covered by Chinese surveillance radar and satellites.\nThe Malaysian, Thai and Indian military radar actually detected the unidentified aircraft but none reacted professionally.\nThe plane flew over North Sumatra, Anambas, South India and landed at the Maldives (some villagers saw the aircraft landing), refuelled and continued its flight to Diego Garcia, the American Air Base in the middle of Indian Ocean. The cargo and the black box were removed. The passengers were silenced by natural means, lack of oxygen. MH370 with dead passengers took off again using remote control and crashed into South Indian Ocean to make it look that the plane eventually ran out of fuel and crashed.\nThe Americans have put up a good show. First diverting all the attention and search effort to the South China Sea while the plane made its way to the Indian Ocean. Then they came out with some conflicting statements and evidence to confuse everyone. \nThe amount of effort put up by China, in terms of the number of search aircraft, ships and satellites, searching first the South China Sea, then the Malacca Straits and the Indian Ocean is unprecedented. This shows that China is very concerned,'

If you are a father, a mother or a human for that matter this should be excruciating for you to see. So As a fellow Kenyan I urge you all to raise your voice and say NO to this atrocities happening today in 20fuxkin14. As a father to a young girl myself, my soul weeps for her and my stomach can\'t bare her pain. I see my daughter in her, we should all see our daughters in her.\n\nHATE begets more hate, hate is a liability of the soul, hate stinks up the joint, hate erodes civilization and stains history.

Only love can muzzle hate speech, only love can pave that bridge of dialogue between communities. \n\nDon\'t be suckered in by the lies spewed by these govt, don\'t sit idly by while these so called  govt is perpetrating this savagery by hiding behind "the war on terror".. These horrific and disturbing images will stain the good name of Kenya for ages to come. Let\'s raise the noise with a unified voice that we won\'t entertain these barbaric acts. So speak up and stand for the oppressed. \n\nAs MLK eloquently put, "In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends". Let\'s save the face of humanity as humans while we still at it. The silent majority pls stand up and say NO injustice. To quote a Swahili saying, "Atakaye kuzika humjui" .

aS"Via Philemon Wesonga\n\nValued Abroad, Often Despised at Home!\n***********************************\nIn one of his many honorary stops in the USA, former Prime Minister Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga is going to be in Atlanta, Washington DC where he will give lectures and  deliver a highly anticipated  keynote address at Harvard University, the number one ranked institution of higher learning in the world. That engagement underlines the academic importance the university attaches to the former Prime Minister who will also have a Q&A session with the post graduate students, probably future world leaders themselves.\n\nOn the flip-side closer home, University of Nairobi, ranked 1479 worldwide by the webometric, cannot seeany reason to invite  Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga for any lecture despite his valued experiences and despite the fact he is a former lecturer at UoN. This number one institution in Kenya, previously invited Mwai Kibaki for a single lecture which later turned out to be one long boring speech where the moderator Jeff Koinange of the bench, ensured if the ten questions fielded, only one was answered vaguely. In a nutshell, no knowledge was imparted on the poor UoN students and they were not allowed a chance to clarify issues or enquire on the 50-year political experiences of the former head of state. In sum, the purported Kibaki lecture was long concluded to have be a PR exercise for an ex-President who inspires very few Kenyan youth, organised by his long time golfing buddy, former Chancellor Joe Wanjui!\n\nWhat an anti-climax to the eventful public life of an individual who had to be pulled as a youth out of his\n\nuniversity teaching job by Jaramogi Oginga Odinga (no less) , who also bought him his first motor vehicle, a peugeot 504, and then went on to influence his appointment to be KANU Executive Officer in 1960, putting him on political path to be Kenya's 3rd president.\n\nTo add insult to injury, unlike our institutions of higher learning, most of these American universities that the former PM is visiting pre-ordered Raila Odinga's biography The Flame of Freedom, leading to its running out of stock sooner than expected. No one is sure if Kibaki will pen memoirs.\n\nFifty years from today, many current American university students will sit down around a fire to tell their grandchildren how they were honoured to attend lectures, listen to keynote speeches that invariably influenced their worldview or lives. They will be telling the story of one of Africa's greatest statesmen. No, it wont be Mandela (RIP). They will be telling the story of Raila Odinga.\n\nWhat will Kenyan  grandfathers and grandmothers say in those times? That they saw the start of construction of a standard gauge railway that was used to scam Kenyans? Or that they stopped governors from flying flags on their cars?"

aS"RESPONSE BY THE ORANGE DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT TO THE STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA; MARCH 28, 2014:\n*******************************************\nFellow Kenyans, yesterday, you heard from the President on the state of our nation.\n\nWe urge you to spend a few minutes with us as we give our side of the story.\nWe are ODM. But it really should not matter because today, we are all hurting. One year after elections, millions of Kenyans are watching and asking; does this government want to stand on our side or in our way.\nOurs is therefore a national call to action on behalf of all the struggling Kenyans. Our main point this morning is; Kenyans deserve far much better than this.\n\nUNITY OF THE NATION:\n\nWe are too divided to build a nation ready to confront its challenges.\n\nJubilee has run the country as a collection of tribes, allies and enemies.\n\nEvery appointment to a public position has been handed down as a gift to supporters, along tribal and party lines. This skewed balance of power poses grave danger to our progress and it must not tilt any further in favour of one or two communities. It must be reversed.\n\nECONOMY AND COST OF LIVING:\n\nOur economy requires urgent, immediate and sustained rethink.\nThe absurd policy of tax and spend has traumatised Kenyans.\n\nFamilies can't pay rent, can't afford food, can't pay school fees and cannot afford bus fare.\n\nIn response, we are seeing and hearing the same-old ideology that we've heard before \xe2\x80\x94 over and over again: Salary cuts, retrenchment of workers, cleaning up the payroll of ghost workers and how there will be just a little more pain before it gets better. Kenyans are going through tremendous pain. It must not get worse.\n\nWe urge the government to focus on eliminating corruption, inefficiency and wastage. Savings from these areas would be sufficient to finance recovery and growth.\nWe advise that the government to put singular focus on food as the biggest driver of cost of living, particularly for the poor.\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s focus on pro-poor agricultural investment as this will result in jobs, containing poverty and reduction in cost of living. Let's pay particular attention to job creation, expansion of economic opportunities particularly for farmers, informal sector, and economically disadvantaged communities.\n\nThe time has come for the government to treat unemployment as a crisis.\n\nWe need a clear road map towards putting millions of Kenyans to work and encouraging companies to hire and not fire people. We have seen no such steps in the last one year.\nJubilee must use its numerical strength in the Houses of Parliament to come up with administrative, regulatory and legislative measures to help small firms start and expand. The cost of bank loans remains unbelievably high despite so much rhetoric about it. But if we are to create job creators and not job seekers, the cost of loans have to fall. Jubilee must use its numbers to champion these positive measures.\nThe government must embrace and engage small contractors and change the way it does business with them. Startups cannot afford to chase payments for months. A simpler engagement would help turn many enterprising young Kenyans into job creators, not job seekers. Small businesses must be treated as the engine of growth, and essential to economic recovery.\n\nCRIME: \nThe greatest responsibility of any government is to protect its people and their property. Yet the last one year has brought us a lot of pain and loses. Lives and property have been lost; thousands have been wounded, businesses have underperformed or closed as a result of spiraling crime.\n \nThis comes after Kenyans worked so hard in the last ten years to create a largely secure nation. By the time Jubilee took over, we had a largely secure nation in which operating a 24 hour economy looked increasingly realistic, not rhetoric.\n\nToday, criminals hunt us in the streets, from our houses, in churches, in mosques, in matatus and in schools.\n \nWe are approaching the first anniversary of the attack on the Westgate Mall. Our hopes and prayers remain with the families that fell victim to this attack. We stand with families who have lost loved ones to criminals across our country. Their pain and horror remain with us.\n \nBut as we moan, we are not convinced that the gaps in our security exposed by those attacks have been closed. The Government is saying the right words about the threat we face. But it has failed to take action commensurate with the threat.\n\nWhen terrorists issue threats and act on them while the government issues threats and fail to track those it is threatening, we know we are on our own as citizens.\nGoods and weapons still enter our borders unnoticed. Fire fighters are still pleading for the tools they need to prevent or respond to an attack.\n\nPoachers have invaded our world famous wildlife heritage with abandon.\n\nPolice are still waiting for comprehensive insurance cover even as we ask them to stand in the line of fire on our behalf.\n \nThe Government has inexplicably refused to form an inquiry into how the attackers in Westgate got here, even after the president promised this. Yesterday, the National Assembly rejected the report by the National Assembly Security Committee on the attack.\n\nWe are therefore calling for the constitution of a Parliamentary Select Committee to investigate the Westgate attack.\n\nWe are also calling for a Parliamentary Select Committee to investigate the rising problem of poaching. We suspect there is more to it than meets the eye. In any case, poaching is part and parcel of our growing security, economic and corruption problems.\n\nWhen a bomb that failed to detonate near the British Airways check-in counter at JKIA late last year, the government shrugged it off as an exploding light-bulb.\n \nAfter the latest attack in Likoni, the Inspector General of Police considered it beneath him to offer an explanation to Kenyans. He let his juniors deal with it. The President and his deputy did not see this as a matter worth their urgent attention. They addressed it in passing on their way to Tanzania.\n\nThese are signs that the government is off track and does not care.\n\nAny discussion of our national security must include recognition and respect for our men and women in uniform.\n\nWhether they are fighting in Somalia or walking our increasingly dangerous streets and borders, we salute them.\n \nThese officers and troops have the gratitude of every Kenya for their courage and the sacrifice they are willing to make on our behalf.\n \nBut we decry the lack of modern equipment, the absence of opportunities for best training that our officers deserve and their dismal working conditions.\n \nAbove all, we ask the government to address the issues of deployments and promotions in the police force, especially now that we are under attack and we are counting on these men and women to be motivated enough to protect us.\n \nPromotions and deployment in the police force is still dogged by tribalism, nepotism and cronyism, not merit.\n \nWe must also talk about our military whose prowess we are all too proud of.\nBecause of the courage of our military, Somalia is a much better place today. We know that Somalia still has persistent insurgency to deal with. It continues to be a magnet for international terrorists.\n \nBut we feel it is time for the Government to present to us a clear plan for ending our presence in Somalia. We are not suggesting that we simply declare the job done and pull out. We are not suggesting we sneak out through the back door.\n\nWe want a clear plan for transferring responsibility for Somalia's security to the Somalis. We believe training the Somali forces to take charge must be expedited. We must accelerate Somalia\xe2\x80\x99s economic development, particularly through infrastructure that gives Somalis a stake in achieving a better future.\n\nWe must also intensify regional and international diplomacy that will deny fuel to the anti-western sentiments that power insurgency in Somalia.\n \nWe want the government to table before Kenyans a comprehensive plan to protect the nation from terrorism. We have only heard promises and more threats.\n \nWe want to see the government's plan to build a military, a police force and an intelligence gathering system that will be second to none. Kenyans are dying because we lack ability to collect timely and reliable intelligence to keep us safe at home.\n\nEDUCATION:\nEven as the government proceeds with the ill-conceived laptops project, we are yet to address the issue of cost of education.\n\nIt is now more than ten years since fees were abolished in public schools. But we know fees exist and are keeping many children out of school. Parents buy uniforms, text books, desks, school buses, pay motivation fees, and much more. We feel the government must climb the education tree from the bottom. Is education free or not? If it is, why are these many levies being imposed and when will they stop?\n \nWe continue to caution the government against the extravagant laptops project. It is not realistic. It is not sustainable and it is not a priority. We support IT in learning and we laud the government for championing it. But we advocate for computer labs in all schools instead of laptops for every child at this stage.\n\nThe cost and built in room for corruption in the acquisition of laptops aside, a bigger question is whether the laptops will actually improve learning. Will reading skills improve because the children have laptops instead of text books? Will children perform better in math and science? Will parents afford the cost of repairs and maintenance? Who will replace crashed or lost and stolen laptops?\n\nCORRUPTION:\n \nWe are concerned about the corruption roulette in government, which Jubilee calls war on corruption. The government admits that thieves have invaded no higher place than the Office of the President.\n\nBut to date, there have been no sackings, no prosecutions, no naming of names. We have been treated to the drama of members of government publicly campaigning for a chance to fix contracts for grand infrastructure projects in return for bribes.\n \nAs we pay lip service and issue warnings at rallies and church functions, corruption is eating into government coffers, paying ghost workers and paying for services not rendered or way above market rates.\n \nYet today, the battle on wages is rated much more urgent by the Jubilee government than the war against corruption. The Jubilee government has now resolved to pay the so-called Anglo-Leasing debts, an outright conduit for corrupt deals. Warnings have run their course. We need action.\n\nRULE OF LAW:\nWe must protect the Constitution and its promises. We must safeguard the rule of law, the media and civil liberties. All these are threatened today. Judges have been called names. Laws have been signed to curb the free media. There have been attempts to limit foreign funding for NGOs.\n\nJubilee government has failed to discontinue extrajudicial killings thus undermining the right to life. As we speak, there is an arbitrary shoot-to-kill order against terrorists as well as other criminals. The country has seen an alarming rise in religious intolerance and religious bigotry which the government has not in any way attempted to manage.\n\nOUR PLEDGE:\nOne year of Jubilee Government has landed us in very uncertain times. How long they times last depends on the government. We want to assure Kenyans that when we believe the Government is on the right track, we will not allow partisan interests stand in the way of what's good for the country. We will be first in line to work with the Government. As at now, we repeat; a Government can do better. Kenyans deserve better.\n \nWe are losing patience with politics of tribalism, nepotism, favoritism, cronyism and rule by fiat. We are tired of incompetence and dishonesty in government.\n\nHON PROF. ANYANG NYONGO\nAg. PARTY LEADER\nODM.\nMARCH 28, 2014."

aS'BY ABU AYMAN\n\nTowards a better understanding of Jihad\n***************************************\n\nThe concept of Jihad is perhaps the most misconstrued and most manipulated concepts in Islam. This misunderstanding regrettably is not only found among non-Muslims but also exists among Muslims as well.\n\nThe misinterpretation has led to Islam to erroneously being seen as a faith which promotes terrorism, violence and sanctions the killing of innocent people.\n\nThe media has also helped to fuel this false notion by occasionally linking jihad with religious extremism and indiscriminate violence.\n\n To many non-Muslims, jihad is defined as holy war and seen as an ideology which calls for Muslims to wage war against non-Muslims.\n\nThis notion has partly been fuelled by the attitudes of some Muslims who consider jihad as a pathway to exert vengeance on non-Muslims because of the oppression of the Muslim populace by state entities.\n\nThese perceptions have cast negative light on the true meaning of jihad and have harmed the image of Islam as a religion which promotes tolerance and supports mutual understanding between the various faiths.\n\nThe misunderstanding of jihad was among the reasons which led to last month\xe2\x80\x99s killing of six people in the police raid on the Musa mosque in Mombasa.\n\nJihad is often translated as \xe2\x80\x9choly war\xe2\x80\x9d waged by Muslims against non-Muslims but this meaning is far from the truth as \xe2\x80\x98holy war\xe2\x80\x99 translated in Arabic is harb al muqaddasatu, a terminology which does not exist in the Qur\xe2\x80\x99an, the hadith-tradition of Prophet Muhammad and in explanations of earlier and contemporary Islamic jurists.\n\n Holy war referred to in Latin as bellum sacrum, ironically has its origin in Christian Europe where wars such as the Crusades and Spanish Reconquista were considered to be religious in nature and blessed by Popes and the Christian clergy to take back Palestine and Andalusia which were under Muslim rule.\n\n Lexically, the term holy war means a conflict pitting one religion against another. There is no verse in the Qur\xe2\x80\x99an or Prophetic tradition that allows Muslims to wage war against any non-Muslim on the sole ground that they are not following Islam. As stated in Baqarah 2:256, the Qur\xe2\x80\x99an is clear that there is no compulsion in religion.\n\n Further, as the prominent Egyptian scholar Sheikh Jamal Badawi stated, Islam does not view war as holy as it involves bloodshed, injury, destruction of properties and human suffering \xe2\x80\x94 principles which Islam strives to protect.\n\n Islamic texts provide evidence that the normative relationships between Muslims and non-Muslims is that of peace, tolerance, justice, mercy, and mutual respect. No single verse in the Qur\xe2\x80\x99an, when placed in its proper textual and historical context, permits fighting others on the basis of their faith, ethnicity or nationality.\n\n In Arabic, the term jihad literarily means \xe2\x80\x9cstruggle\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cstriving.\xe2\x80\x9d In the Qur\xe2\x80\x99an, it is a word that is distinct from qital, which means armed fighting.\n\n Jihad is a central and broad concept that includes the efforts for an individual to be a better Muslim, to make struggle to improve the quality of life in society \xe2\x80\x94 for both Muslims and non-Muslims, fighting against tyranny or oppression and the struggle on the battlefield to defend Islam and Muslims.\n\n According to Islamic teachings, jihad is an obligation upon all Muslims to strive against all forms of oppression, injustice, tyranny and oppression. Jihad can be made with the pen and also with the tongue to ordain and promote good and also to prevent evil in the society.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe highest form of jihad is to speak the truth in the face of an unjust ruler\xe2\x80\x9d is an impeccably authenticated saying of Prophet Muhammad which suffices to dispel the utterly false impression that jihad is synonymous with warfare.\n\nJihad also involves the propagation of Islam and Muslims are required to spread the message of Islam with wisdom, tolerance and respect of others beliefs.\n\nIt is prudent for Muslims to enlighten non-Muslims about the true teachings of Islam and also to correct mistaken beliefs among Muslims about the faith.\n\nThe 8th century Islamic scholar Ibn Hajar al-\xe2\x80\x98Asqalani, in his prominent commentary Fathul Baari on the traditions of Prophet Muhammad, explained, \xe2\x80\x9cJihad is not limited to military fighting against an enemy, but it refers to striving hard and struggling against one\xe2\x80\x99s own self, against impulses of the devil, and in enjoining the doing of what is right and good and forbidding the doing of what is wrong and evil in the society.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n The combative jihad is allowed in the Qur\xe2\x80\x99an for legitimate self-defence in the face of unprovoked aggression or resisting severe oppression on religious or other grounds.\n\n War in Islam is not to convert people by force, or to colonise people or to acquire land or wealth or for self-glory. Its purpose is basically to defend life, property, land, honour and freedom for oneself as well as defence of others from injustice and oppression.\n\n Islam forbids Muslims to be initiators or aggressors, but it permits them to defend themselves when necessary. The Qur\xe2\x80\x99an issues this decree as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cFight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but begin not hostilities. Indeed Allah does not like transgressors.\xe2\x80\x9d [Qur\xe2\x80\x99an 2:190]\n\n More so, even on the battlefield, there are clear regulations as taught by Prophet Muhammad which requires Muslims when engaging in battle to be fair and just.\n\nThese clear laid down rules of war forbid the killing of non-combatants and there is no justification for what is known in modern language as collateral damage \xe2\x80\x94 killing of innocent women, children and the elderly.\n\nDuring times of war, houses of worship such as churches and synagogues and their occupants are expressly prohibited from being attacked. In addition, cutting down of trees and destroying infrastructure which has no military or strategic importance is forbidden. Prisoners of war should also be treated as humanely as possible.\n\nIn times of conflict when there is an inclination on the part of the enemy towards peace, Muslims are commanded to cease fighting and open doors of negotiations with the aggressor to ensure that peace is ultimately achieved.\n\nOne thousand and four hundred years ago, Islam formulated the ethics of war long before the Geneva Conventions came into being.\n\n The purpose of any battle is to restore peace and not to promote violence and the Qur\xe2\x80\x99an has provided the circumstances under which defensive warfare is permissible and Muslims are strictly forbidden from transgressing these parameters.\n\n Killing of innocent civilians, whether through aggression or suicidal means, is under no circumstances permissible in Islam. Islam encourages the oppressed people to struggle for their liberation and it commands other Muslims to help those who are oppressed and suffering, but Islam does not allow, under any circumstance, the killing of non-combatants and innocent people.\n\n Unfortunately some people have gone ahead to quote Quranic verses out of context to wrongly justify acts of violence and the indiscriminate killing of innocent people.\n\nThe Quran categorically forbids the killing of any innocent soul which is categorised under major sins. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden, except by right.\xe2\x80\x9d (17:33). It further states that, \xe2\x80\x9cWhoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land \xe2\x80\x94 it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one \xe2\x80\x94 it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. (5:32)\n\n From an Islamic perspective, ends do not justify means and to achieve a just purpose it must be done in a just and legitimate way.\n\nThe fact remains that Islamic teachings are not derived by what some Muslims are doing today or by misinterpretations and the best way to understand Islam is through its sources.\n\n Jihad is never a tool of waging war against the innocent; it is never a means of flexing muscles or bullying the weak and oppressed.\n\nIslam aims at establishing a world order where all human beings \xe2\x80\x94 Muslims and non-Muslims \xe2\x80\x94 can live with justice in peace, harmony and good will.\n\n It therefore becomes a cardinal duty for Muslims to join hands with others in working for peace and justice for all people and co-operate in matters of goodness and virtue to nurture a society which promotes peace, fairness and justice and to stop all acts of aggression, impunity and violence against innocent people. This should be our jihad today.\n\nAbu Ayman is a Nairobi-based journalist. abuayman888@yahoo.com'

This is how they performed;\n\nJohn Oor Oyioka KANU 8,987\nZebedeo Opore Ford P 8,992\nCharles Onyancha ODM 6,897\nAlbert Monyancha WIPER 160\n\nFrom the above figures, it is clear the ODM candidate lost. What I am yet to understand is whether the political dynamic have changed on the ground in his favor. In Kisii, the governor won with over 260,000 votes agains the Tnas candidate who gote 63,000 votes. Cord also had two strong candidates for the senate in Kisii, Magara (PDP) who got 100,000 votes and Obure (ODM) who got over 120,000 votes. This, clearly demonstrate that Kisii was fully #CORDED and therefore, CORD candidates ought to have shared position 1 and 2 respectively.\n\nGoing further to the presidential results, Raila Odinga 25,984 against Uhuru Kenya 7040 in Bonchari. It is there clear that our candidate in Kisii was unpopular or did not take his campaigns serious. From his figures above, it is clear that the 6,897 people who voted for him, actually voted for the party, and not him.\n\nIf ODM want to win the seat, I think it will only be through a credible party nomination. If Onyancha want to win back the seat, he should push the party to conduct nominations and plot to win it.\n\nFailure to conduct nomination for this seat will definately mean ODM forgetting about the seat.\n\n#ChamaIkoImara #TeamBaba Online Force'

aS'VIA MOHAMED WARSOMA>\n\nBLOGGERS, I have just emailed the following to Manoah Esipisu, Head of the PSCU, Interior Secretary Joseph Ole Lenku, House Majority Leader Duale, Presidential Legal Adviser Abdikadir Mohammed, Political Affairs Director Joshua Kutuny, Legislative Advisor to DP Ruto, Jasper Mbiuki, President\'s Speechwriter Eric Ng\'eno, and four MPs in TNA and URP with close access to Uhuruto. I hope my advice will be taken. I don\'t want problems for my people, if I can help it.\n \nOPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT KENYATTA\n\nMr President, in the K24 Video Clip aired on April 3, and on which this below post was based and which has since then been withdrawn as "private" by the TV station, you are quoted as advising DP Ruto and other top officials not to let their wives move around for security reasons.\nI now wish to strongly appeal to you for security reasons, not to permit the First Lady, Mrs Margaret Kenyatta, to take part in the London Half Marathon Race for these very good reasons:\nl. You drew attention to security danger towards the wife of Mr Ruto by your public warning she and other top wives should not expose themselves to danger. So any terrorist can have that idea in mind as a result of your warning;\n2. You should also live by the same advice you gave to Mr Ruto concerning his wife. What is good for Mrs Ruto should also be good for the First Lady.\n3. London is the home of the White Widow reported by a British newspaper to be planning revenge for Makaburi\'s death.\n4. London is the home of British terrorist Jermaine Grant now on trial in Mombasa.\n5. London is the home of an active Salafist group. Makaburi was a Salafist.\n6. The First Lady would be a soft moving target in the Marathon. Remember athletes will be running in singles and doubles on a long stretch of road with the crowd very close to them.\n7. It is unprecedented and unheard of for a First Lady to go to a foreign land to take part in an athletic race. She could attend a charity function, but to run in a race ? I don\'t think so. When John Kennedy was set to pay his first State Visit to Britain, his wife asked him whether she should kneel for the Queen. And Kennedy told her definitely not, since she was the First Lady of another country.\n8. Lastly let us avoid looking for problems. We Muslims are burdened enough already with the terrorist blame game. So please keep the First Lady safely at home.\n\nMohamed Warsama\nJournalist'

aS"STATE OF AND RESPONSE TO INSECURITY\n\nThat we are in the middle of insecurity nightmare is no longer in doubt and not really new. Security has systematically degenerated in the last one year, from sporadic explosions in border towns of northern Kenya, to banditry, cattle rustling and gangs across different parts of the country,which have passed without much action from the government.\n\nKenyans will remember the wave of attacks that gripped parts of Western Kenya around this time last year, beginning in Bungoma, spreading to Busia, Mt Elgon and parts of Kakamega with no explanations to date.\n\nThe murders in Nyanza that claimed the parents of a Member of Parliament remain unexplained. The mayhem has spread to Nairobi, where previously safe neighborhoods like Karen have lately witnessed unprecedented crime wave. Those in lesser affluent estates long accepted it as their fate to be insecure. Shoot outs in the streets of Nairobi have become normal again.\n\nNairobi, Mombasa, Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit have lived with explosives and grenades going off everywhere for much of the past year without convincing explanations and without anyone being held to account.\n\nThe climax for all these was the attack on Westgate that left upto 70 people dead, hundreds injured and losses running into billions. No explanation has been offered to date. But we all remember that President Uhuru Kenyatta promised in broad daylight and in public that he would institute an inquiry into the attack. There was even an explosion at the airport which the authorities said, and want us to believe, was a falling light bulb. That is how ridiculous it has been in the last one year.\n\nThe government has a duty, responsibility and right to protect the lives and property of citizens. In fact this is the only reason people agree to form governments. We however do not believe that reactive swoops and return to slumber thereafter as we have witnessed in the last one year, including what is going on today, presents some kind of well thought out and well designed response to the security challenges we face. There is an element of insecurity we are focusing ontoday called Al Shabaab which we believe ought to be handled better, though it ought not be treated as the only threat.\n\nIn recent days, hundreds of mostly young people have been arrested and detained in Nairobi, Mombasa and other parts of the country. Hundreds have been deported to Somalia for being illegally in Kenya. Tens have been shot dead across the country in the name of fighting terrorism and crime. Police continue to harass young jobless men in the name of maintaining law and order, in most cases demanding for cash to release the innocent young Kenyans.\n\nGiven the situation above, as a party, we are making the following demands:\n\n1: The mere presence of hundreds of illegal immigrants within our borders, who entered without our notice, is in itself a manifestation of serious lapses in our security, intelligence and immigration system. We need a thorough audit of our security, intelligence and immigration agencies. Heads need and must to roll in the intelligence, police and immigration departments as part of a major effort to secure our country. It will not work that the very people who allowed the immigrants in, most times after collecting bribes from them, are then made to conduct swoops and deport the same after a crime has been committed. We need to get to the bottom of the corruption cartels in immigration, intelligence and police who are making our country insecure by allowing people illegally into our country in return for money.\n\n2: We must get to the bottom of the biggest security lapse in our country in twenty years and that is the attack on Westgate Mall. All Kenyans remember that President Uhuru Kenyatta promised an inquiry. We welcomed this because understanding how Westgate happened is critical to unraveling how terror groups operate and the loopholes in our security, intelligence and social systems that they exploit and which need to be sealed. Close to a year later, there is no inquiry and there are no signs there shall ever be one. The expectation seems to be that Kenyans will just accept and move on. We are asking, what does President Uhuru know about Westgate? Why does the president fear investigating this incident? We are demanding that\n\ninvestigations, preferably by a select committee of both Houses of Parliament be carried out without further delay.\n\n3: Talking about terrorism, we ask the government to take time and understand Al Shabaab in its many dimensions to be able to fight it effectively. Al Shabaabism has become a movement with at least three dimensions all of which cannot be dealt with by swoops, friskings and deportations as it is happening today. There are Jihadist Al Shabaab that believe in converting everyone to Islam as the only way to save the world and to defeat the West. There is the economic Al Shabaab, those who join this movement because of temporary hope it offers through handouts and forms of employment particularly to the desperate youth. There is the pure criminal and opportunistic Al Shabaab. These are people joining this movement to extort money and create opportunities for themselves by exploiting the failures of the state. These people are not necessarily religious, young or poor. They simply want to make hay while the sun shines. We need to address the political economy of Al Shabaabism. We have heard the president asking Kenyans to join him and help fight terrorism. The nation cannot help the president fight terrorism unless he joins us in analyzing and seeks our understanding Al Shabaabism. We will be firing in the dark if we think the war can be won through shoot to kill orders and chaotic round ups we are witnessing today.\n\n4: The National Government must rethink its desire to monopolize security. This country is crying for an approach to security that does not have to rely on the gun or the police. The constitution has very clear provisions that would secure Kenya all the way to the villages if implemented honestly. If Village Councils were allowed to operate as envisaged, nobody would enter our country without being noticed. We would not need another layer called either. Village councils were supposed to close the gap between the masses and the government. They must be put in place immediately and given the tools to operate effectively.\n\n5: Police reform must proceed with a clear understanding of the needs of society. Promotions and deployments need to based on merit. There should be clear standards on who can enter the force with what level of education and what academic qualification assures one of what rank. The civilian wing of the force needs to be strengthened, not undermined.\n\n6: The issue of illegal immigrants in Kenya needs to be addressed urgently and independently of the insecurity we are witnessing. It has nothing to do with refugees. Kenya has had refugees for a very long time. We had long perfected a system of documenting refugees. It is therefore wrong to lump refugees with illegal immigrants. A purposeful implementation of devolution is critical in this regard. Village councils will know who the citizens are if they are allowed to operate and if they are sensitized to their security role.\n\n7: We reject attempts to reinvent the old colonial structures including the provincial administration using insecurity as an excuse. We went for devolution because the old structure failed. We appeal to the government to strengthen devolved units and cede some security roles so that we have a system, accountable to the people, and that runs all the way to the ground.\n\n8: We wish to express strong displeasure at the swoops going on today, which resemble Operation Anvil of the Mau Mau era or the Wagalla operation of the 1980s. Operation Anvil can easily lead to ethnic profiling. We do not think indiscriminate picking of Somalis is the answer. Al Shabaab is no longer a Somali issue. We wish to remind the government that in countries where the war on crime and terror has taken ethnic, racial or religious dimension, the conflicts has ended up being more complex and more protracted. We fear Kenya is taking that unfortunate route. We want to believe that in a country that upholds the rule of law and basic freedoms, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve done nothing wrong, you deserve nothing but respect and courtesy from the authorities. We haven't seen that in the crackdown that looks modeled along operation Anvil of the Mau Mau era. Inspector Genera of Police, NIS director and CID director owe our country a better job or they should pack and leave.\n\n9: Given the Somalia aspect to our security problems, we are asking the government give us the time table of withdrawing from Somalia. We are not saying we should declare victory and leave. We are not saying we sneak out. We want to see a plan for a systematic handing over of Somalia to its citizens. We reject this chest thumping by the government about how we are in Somalia to stay. Kenya and AMISON must have a partnership for reconstruction of Somali state.\n\n10: We want the government to share with Kenyans its plans for engaging the youth in meaningful activities for earning a living so that they do not have to turn to criminal networks like Al Shabaab to earn a living. Throwing money at the problem, like the creation of on top of the existing youth fund is not making any difference.\n\nThank you and God Bless Kenya.\n\nProf. Anyang\xe2\x80\x99 Nyong\xe2\x80\x99o\n\nAg.

The sermons are in protest over the death of Sheikh Abubakar Shariff alias Makaburi.\n\nMakaburi was shot dead in Mombasa town last Tuesday evening. Mombasa county police boss Robert Kitur said detectives are analysing the contents of messages given to Muslim worshippers.\n\nHe said the messages urged worshippers to "cleanse Mombasa of infidels". Speaking to the Star yesterday, Kitur said they are profiling the speaker and Imam from the mosque.\n\nPolice said the two are among "radical" preachers that said worshipers should "prepare to revenge" Makaburi\xe2\x80\x99s death. Kitur said the message directed muslims to be-head the kufars (non-muslims) in the neighbourhood.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe distressing message is aimed at inciting and plunging the county into religious violence. We are looking for the two whom we believe are from Majengo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nKitur said two have been positively identified and their details shared among security agencies. \xe2\x80\x9cThey will be arrested and charged with incitement to violence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitur.\n\nDuring the Friday prayers the radical youth mourned the execution of Makaburi and Muslim clerics among them the late Sheikh Aboud Rogo. Makaburi was buried as a martyr in bloodied clothes without being washed at Manyimbo cemetery in Tudor where his followers prayed for Allah to grant him shahadaa (religious witness status) as he had died fighting for the religion.\n\nThey claimed he was murdered by the government security agencies, an allegation that the state has repeatedly denied. Kitur said police are still monitoring activities at Masjid Shuhadaa believed to be a hot bed for radicalisation and used by Islamic preachers to fund terrorism activities and to recruit Al-Shabaab militants.\n\nOn Friday, police deterred followers of slain radical preacher Makaburi from demonstrating against his killing. The mosque was under siege for hours by a combined team of paramilitary and regular police in anti-riot gear had who used tear gas canisters to disperse a section of the youth after the Friday prayers.\n\nAt least 300 police officers were deployed to Mombasa as the government intensified the war on terrorism. The officers drawn from General Service Unit and Administration Police units were deployed to areas identified as prone to insecurity.\n\nThe focus for the officers has been concentrated within Majengo, Kisauni and Likoni areas perceived to hold terror cells which are breeding areas for al-Shabaab followers.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have sufficient officers to ensure we restore peace in the county and urge those still holding firearms to surrender them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kitur. Mombasa county commissioner Nelson Marwa said a permanent police station has been established at Likoni channel to deal with terror threats.\n\nMarwa said the station has been assigned special squad that will be permanently attached at the channel under the command of an Officer Commanding Station (OCS) to ensure safety.\n\nReliable police sources confirmed that Likoni channel, where thousands of commuters and motorist use daily, is a soft target for terrorists. The government has announced that security measures including CCTV cameras have been restored at the channel.\n\n-'

aS'Every Christian or Muslims must read this article by MOHAMED WARSAME - Truly a Master piece!\n\nSadly, there are many Christians in this country who tend to blame the Muslim community collectively for what a handful of persons are doing, yet their actions are not Islamic or Quran-based. Why do these Christians keep on forgetting that Muslims suffer equally like Christians from terrorist bombs and bullets? Do terrorist grenades thrown into a matatu select Christian targets only and spare Muslims? What religion is Kamukunji MP Yusuf Hassan who survived a terrorist grenade attack on December 7, 2012, but a small child who was nearby - also a Muslim - was blown to pieces.\n\nWe as Muslims never blamed Kenyan Christians when 80 Somalis were massacred at Wagalla in Wajir County by the Moi regime in 1980. Was the burning of 35 worshippers at Kiambaa Church in Eldoret seen in a Christian context? The Alshabaab that has killed a few hundred Kenyans in Kenya killed thousands of Somalis in their country Somalia. More Muslims have been killed by Christians globally than Christians were killed by Muslims.\n\nAccording to the British Guardian newspaper, as many as 20,000 Afghan civilians were killed in 2001 by US airstrikes and ground invasion. In December, 2006, a tearful Afghan President Hamid Karzai lamented that Afghan children were being maimed and killed by NATO, US and terrorism. According to the Iraqi Body Count Project, there were 112,667-123,284 civilian deaths, and 174,000 civilian and combatant deaths in Iraq between March, 2003-March, 2013. A report released February 27, this year by Amnesty International titled "Trigger-happy Israel\'s use of excessive force in the West Bank," said Israeli forces displayed a callous disregard for human life by killing dozens of Palestinian civilians including children in the occupied West Bank in the past three years with impunity."\n\nWhen Christians therefore blame the whole Muslim community in Kenya for the murderous actions of a few misguided elements, should we then blame the Christian world for the slaughter of Muslims in Afghanistan, Iraq and Israel? By the way, MUHURI in Mombasa is still waiting for the police to disclose the names of the two persons police claimed were killed by them for the Likoni church attack. MUHURI has said the information they have is one of them has a Christian name and the other is yet to be established. So why is this important detail being withheld from the public domain?\n\n Mohamed Warsame is a Canadian Citizen.'

aS"Mombasa, Kwale matatus crisis hits commuters\n\nMombasa residents have for the second week faced a transport crisis following the continued crackdown on public transport vehicles.\n\n Majority of residents have been forced to walk to work, while others seek alternative modes of transport.\n\n The Reformed Matatu Owners Association blamed the crisis on lack of enough digital speed governors in Mombasa among other issues.\n\n Speaking to the Star in Mombasa yesterday, the association's chairman Elvis Kipkoech said there is a shortage on the recommended digital speed governors.\n\n He said efforts to purchase the garget in Nairobi have not been fruitful. Kipkoech said they have been told the digital gadgets are out of stock.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cMajority of operators have opted to ground their vehicles to avoid being impounded for not complying with the rules. There is a major shortage on speed governors which has seen only 30 per cent of matatus comply with the traffic rules,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\n Kipkoech said most matatus have complied with most rules including the Sacco rule, which demands that they belong to a Sacco with at least 30 serviceable vehicles.\n\n He said the few that have complied with safety requirements are still keeping off the road due to issues such as the multi-colour rule, which requires PSV\xe2\x80\x99s colour to match with the one on the logbook.\n\n The association appealed to the Transport ministry, police and National Transport and Safety Authority to give more time on issues that are not affecting road safety.\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cSome things like colour have no effect on road safety. We ask the government to look at the safety concerns first and once the vehicle is inspected for road worthiness, it should be allowed back on the road. The rest like colours can be changed with time. Let\xe2\x80\x99s be logical on these issues. Kenyans are suffering which is also hurting the economy,\xe2\x80\x9d Kipkoech said.\n-"

aS'OPPOSITION STAND ON THE #StateOfTheNationKE\n\nFellow Kenyans, yesterday, you heard from the President on the state of our nation.\n\nWe urge you to spend a few minutes with us as we give our side of the story.\nWe are ODM. But it really should not matter because today, we are all hurting. One year after elections, millions of Kenyans are watching and asking; does this government want to stand on our side or in our way.\nOurs is therefore a national call to action on behalf of all the struggling Kenyans. Our main point this morning is; Kenyans deserve far much better than this.\n\nUNITY OF THE NATION:\n\nWe are too divided to build a nation ready to confront its challenges.\n\nJubilee has run the country as a collection of tribes, allies and enemies.\nEvery appointment to a public position has been handed down as a gift to supporters, along tribal and party lines. This skewed balance of power poses grave danger to our progress and it must not tilt any further in favour of one or two communities. It must be reversed.\n\nECONOMY AND COST OF LIVING:\n\nOur economy requires urgent, immediate and sustained rethink.\nThe absurd policy of tax and spend has traumatised Kenyans.\n\nFamilies can\xe2\x80\x99t pay rent, can\xe2\x80\x99t afford food, can\xe2\x80\x99t pay school fees and cannot afford bus fare.\n\nIn response, we are seeing and hearing the same-old ideology that we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard before \xe2\x80\x94 over and over again: Salary cuts, retrenchment of workers, cleaning up the payroll of ghost workers and how there will be just a little more pain before it gets better. Kenyans are going through tremendous pain. It must not get worse.\n\nWe urge the government to focus on eliminating corruption, inefficiency and wastage. Savings from these areas would be sufficient to finance recovery and growth.\nWe advise that the government to put singular focus on food as the biggest driver of cost of living, particularly for the poor.\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s focus on pro-poor agricultural investment as this will result in jobs, containing poverty and reduction in cost of living. Let\xe2\x80\x99s pay particular attention to job creation, expansion of economic opportunities particularly for farmers, informal sector, and economically disadvantaged communities.\n\nThe time has come for the government to treat unemployment as a crisis.\n\nWe need a clear road map towards putting millions of Kenyans to work and encouraging companies to hire and not fire people. We have seen no such steps in the last one year.\nJubilee must use its numerical strength in the Houses of Parliament to come up with administrative, regulatory and legislative measures to help small firms start and expand. The cost of bank loans remains unbelievably high despite so much rhetoric about it. But if we are to create job creators and not job seekers, the cost of loans have to fall. Jubilee must use its numbers to champion these positive measures.\nThe government must embrace and engage small contractors and change the way it does business with them. Startups cannot afford to chase payments for months. A simpler engagement would help turn many enterprising young Kenyans into job creators, not job seekers. Small businesses must be treated as the engine of growth, and essential to economic recovery.\n\nCRIME:\nThe greatest responsibility of any government is to protect its people and their property. Yet the last one year has brought us a lot of pain and loses. Lives and property have been lost; thousands have been wounded, businesses have underperformed or closed as a result of spiraling crime.\n\nThis comes after Kenyans worked so hard in the last ten years to create a largely secure nation. By the time Jubilee took over, we had a largely secure nation in which operating a 24 hour economy looked increasingly realistic, not rhetoric.\n\nToday, criminals hunt us in the streets, from our houses, in churches, in mosques, in matatus and in schools.\n\nWe are approaching the first anniversary of the attack on the Westgate Mall. Our hopes and prayers remain with the families that fell victim to this attack. We stand with families who have lost loved ones to criminals across our country. Their pain and horror remain with us.\n\nBut as we moan, we are not convinced that the gaps in our security exposed by those attacks have been closed. The Government is saying the right words about the threat we face. But it has failed to take action commensurate with the threat.\n\nWhen terrorists issue threats and act on them while the government issues threats and fail to track those it is threatening, we know we are on our own as citizens.\nGoods and weapons still enter our borders unnoticed. Fire fighters are still pleading for the tools they need to prevent or respond to an attack.\n\nPoachers have invaded our world famous wildlife heritage with abandon.\n\nPolice are still waiting for comprehensive insurance cover even as we ask them to stand in the line of fire on our behalf.\n\nThe Government has inexplicably refused to form an inquiry into how the attackers in Westgate got here, even after the president promised this. Yesterday, the National Assembly rejected the report by the National Assembly Security Committee on the attack.\n\nWe are therefore calling for the constitution of a Parliamentary Select Committee to investigate the Westgate attack.\n\nWe are also calling for a Parliamentary Select Committee to investigate the rising problem of poaching. We suspect there is more to it than meets the eye. In any case, poaching is part and parcel of our growing security, economic and corruption problems.\n\nWhen a bomb that failed to detonate near the British Airways check-in counter at JKIA late last year, the government shrugged it off as an exploding light-bulb.\n\nAfter the latest attack in Likoni, the Inspector General of Police considered it beneath him to offer an explanation to Kenyans. He let his juniors deal with it. The President and his deputy did not see this as a matter worth their urgent attention. They addressed it in passing on their way to Tanzania.\n\nThese are signs that the government is off track and does not care.\n\nAny discussion of our national security must include recognition and respect for our men and women in uniform.\n\nWhether they are fighting in Somalia or walking our increasingly dangerous streets and borders, we salute them.\n\nThese officers and troops have the gratitude of every Kenya for their courage and the sacrifice they are willing to make on our behalf.\n\nBut we decry the lack of modern equipment, the absence of opportunities for best training that our officers deserve and their dismal working conditions.\n\nAbove all, we ask the government to address the issues of deployments and promotions in the police force, especially now that we are under attack and we are counting on these men and women to be motivated enough to protect us.\n\nPromotions and deployment in the police force is still dogged by tribalism, nepotism and cronyism, not merit.\n\nWe must also talk about our military whose prowess we are all too proud of.\nBecause of the courage of our military, Somalia is a much better place today. We know that Somalia still has persistent insurgency to deal with. It continues to be a magnet for international terrorists.\n\nBut we feel it is time for the Government to present to us a clear plan for ending our presence in Somalia. We are not suggesting that we simply declare the job done and pull out. We are not suggesting we sneak out through the back door.\n\nWe want a clear plan for transferring responsibility for Somalia\xe2\x80\x99s security to the Somalis. We believe training the Somali forces to take charge must be expedited. We must accelerate Somalia\xe2\x80\x99s economic development, particularly through infrastructure that gives Somalis a stake in achieving a better future.\n\nWe must also intensify regional and international diplomacy that will deny fuel to the anti-western sentiments that power insurgency in Somalia.\n\nWe want the government to table before Kenyans a comprehensive plan to protect the nation from terrorism. We have only heard promises and more threats.\n\nWe want to see the government\xe2\x80\x99s plan to build a military, a police force and an intelligence gathering system that will be second to none. Kenyans are dying because we lack ability to collect timely and reliable intelligence to keep us safe at home.\n\nEDUCATION:\nEven as the government proceeds with the ill-conceived laptops project, we are yet to address the issue of cost of education.\n\nIt is now more than ten years since fees were abolished in public schools. But we know fees exist and are keeping many children out of school. Parents buy uniforms, text books, desks, school buses, pay motivation fees, and much more. We feel the government must climb the education tree from the bottom. Is education free or not? If it is, why are these many levies being imposed and when will they stop?\n\nWe continue to caution the government against the extravagant laptops project. It is not realistic. It is not sustainable and it is not a priority. We support IT in learning and we laud the government for championing it. But we advocate for computer labs in all schools instead of laptops for every child at this stage.\n\nThe cost and built in room for corruption in the acquisition of laptops aside, a bigger question is whether the laptops will actually improve learning. Will reading skills improve because the children have laptops instead of text books? Will children perform better in math and science? Will parents afford the cost of repairs and maintenance? Who will replace crashed or lost and stolen laptops?\n\nCORRUPTION:\n\nWe are concerned about the corruption roulette in government, which Jubilee calls war on corruption. The government admits that thieves have invaded no higher place than the Office of the President.\n\nBut to date, there have been no sackings, no prosecutions, no naming of names. We have been treated to the drama of members of government publicly campaigning for a chance to fix contracts for grand infrastructure projects in return for bribes.\n\nAs we pay lip service and issue warnings at rallies and church functions, corruption is eating into government coffers, paying ghost workers and paying for services not rendered or way above market rates.\n\nYet today, the battle on wages is rated much more urgent by the Jubilee government than the war against corruption. The Jubilee government has now resolved to pay the so-called Anglo-Leasing debts, an outright conduit for corrupt deals. Warnings have run their course. We need action.\n\nRULE OF LAW:\nWe must protect the Constitution and its promises. We must safeguard the rule of law, the media and civil liberties. All these are threatened today. Judges have been called names. Laws have been signed to curb the free media. There have been attempts to limit foreign funding for NGOs.\n\nJubilee government has failed to discontinue extrajudicial killings thus undermining the right to life. As we speak, there is an arbitrary shoot-to-kill order against terrorists as well as other criminals. The country has seen an alarming rise in religious intolerance and religious bigotry which the government has not in any way attempted to manage.\n\nOUR PLEDGE:\nOne year of Jubilee Government has landed us in very uncertain times. How long they times last depends on the government. We want to assure Kenyans that when we believe the Government is on the right track, we will not allow partisan interests stand in the way of what\xe2\x80\x99s good for the country. We will be first in line to work with the Government. As at now, we repeat; a Government can do better. Kenyans deserve better.\n\nWe are losing patience with politics of tribalism, nepotism, favoritism, cronyism and rule by fiat. We are tired of incompetence and dishonesty in government.\n\nHON PROF. ANYANG NYONGO\nAg. PARTY LEADER\nODM.\nMARCH 28, 2014.'

Similarly, when Deputy President William Ruto does the same, his people become the first people to defend and protect his actions.\nI'm shocked that the very people who protect and defend the President and his deputy whenever they does tribal terrorism are the same people chiding Aden Duale for defending the rights of Muslims (Somalis) who are being mistreated by the same government some of them voted in. Legislators Alice Wahome (Kandara), Kigo Njenga (Gatundu North) and Jude Njomo (Kiambu town) all from Uhuru's stronghold were the first to fire at Duale over his threats to quit the jubilee government because of arbitrary arrest of his people.What does that show? Why is it right for Uhuru to have his people but Wrong for Duale to have his people too?\nMost importantly , We know the men and women charged with responsibility of ensuring an efficient and effective security systems in this country. We know the kind of lapse that was there during the West gate operation, We know the kind of protection that they got from the President and his deputy, We also know they got intelligence information but kinda deliberately refused to act.Kenyans saw rejection of the shallow Westgate report presented in parliament two weeks ago citing incompetence and distortion of information by the committee tasked to do the job.\nWhen Mungikis were a menace in the country, I didn't see the government detaining thousands of Kikuyus in those deplorable police cells to weed them out.\nIt is worth noting that presumption of innocence till proven guilty only applies when ICC is on our neck, that freedom of association and assembly is only applicable when ours is threatened, that the right to fair hearing only applies when it is me, my friend,my family or my tribe.\nThe Jubilee supporters and government should stop this HYPOCRISY and do what is right towards the betterment of this nation, their hypocrisy is a disaster in waiting."

Njeri Gatabaki, the County Executive Committee Member responsible for Roads, Transport & Public Works, will tomorrow tour Githunguri Sub-County as they launch several roads that have undergone various works. The County Government has completed full construction of about 35 Km of access roads in Githunguri Sub-County at Ksh 25.4 million and a full list of the works in this Sub-County is outlined below.   Procurement for rehabilitation of Githunguri-Ndumberi road is at an advanced stage. We hope to handover to the Contractor in about one week's time. \n\nWith respect to the rest of the County, the County Government has so far graded over 550 Km of road on routine maintenance program.  In addition, we have completed full periodic maintenance (grading, graveling, watering and compaction) of about 180 Km of rural access roads throughout the County.   The County Government targets to complete periodic maintenance of 480 Km (minimum 8 Km per Ward) by the end of this Financial year with an estimated budget of about Ksh 450 Million.\n\nThe County Government has also commenced on the procurement of contractors to tarmac roads in all the eight towns in Kiambu County. In Githunguri town, we plan to tarmac 3 Km and gravel 2 Km of the roads around the market and shopping areas to facilitate commercial activities within the town. This will also include construction of storm drains and installation of solar street lighting and the work is expected to commence by mid May 2014. \n\nLastly, on roads, we are happy to report that, after immense pressure from the County Government and the residents of Kiambu, KENHA has finally contracted Ruiru-Uplands road (C65), which is a national road falling outside of the mandate of the County Government, to a Contractor to undertake rehabilitation works.   \n\nThe rehabilitation of 12 bus parks (one per Sub-County) has commenced and work is on-going and scheduled to complete this Financial year. Procurement for 60 boda boda sheds (one per Ward) is at an advanced stage and contractors should be on the ground in the course of April 2014.\n\nWe are in the process of finalisng the designs and tender documentation for the construction of  fire stations in all 8 major towns in Kiambu County.  Construction of two fire stations in Limuru and Ruiru towns is scheduled to start this Financial year. The County Government plans to have fully fledged fire stations in all urban areas (including Githunguri) by mid 2016. The stations will be adequately equipped and manned 24/7. \n\nWARD ROAD  LENGTH AMOUNT   SURFACE TYPE REMARKS\n\n1.

She moved to the USA in 2002 after resigning from her Computer Programmer job at the then Kenya Breweries (now EABL). She stayed as an illegal immigrant in USA before applying for asylum claiming that there was violence in Kenya.  She was denied asylum in 2004 but retained legal representation.\n\nHer case was leaked to the media prompting US\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to order an internal review on asylum deportations.

The police might then end up executing the wrong people. \n\nTo complicate matters further, Muslim leaders have claimed that not only were the police informed in advance about a likely attack on the church, but that a marital dispute involving the pastor might have been behind the attack. \n\nIf al Shabaab was not responsible for the Likoni attack, this shoot-to-kill hysteria might be totally misplaced. The police have always operated an unofficial shoot-to-kill policy. \n\nThieves are regularly eliminated. Some, or many, of those executed may well have been innocent. But if that unofficial shoot-to-kill becomes official, the present low level conflict at the Coast could rapidly escalate into all-out war. \n\nMarwa\xe2\x80\x99s instruction was reckless and unethical.

This time too, the target was said to be a large shopping mall. \n\nAnd it is only by pure luck that these hidden bombs were discovered, days after the driver of this potentially-lethal car was seized by the police. \n\nAs for the accounts of badly overloaded matatus and buses which were allowed to continue on their way by traffic policemen, only to roll off the road and kill many on board, these have almost ceased to surprise most Kenyans by now. \n\nNo matter where you look, the same pattern emerges of corruption and incompetence as the underlying factors behind the security crisis that has had Kenya in its grip for some time. \n\nAnd what is true for the citizens of this country, is also true for animals: barely a day passes by, but we have news of yet another elephant or rhino killed, and the tusks or horn hacked off. \n\nAnd though in some cases, this happens in remote locations which would be difficult to patrol under the best of circumstances, surprisingly often the killings take place within earshot of some rangers\xe2\x80\x99 camp; or in a well-fenced compound within a game park or conservancy. \n\nWhat other explanation can there be for this, other than that the same corruption and incompetence which allows suicide bombers to drive into our country, without meeting any resistance, is what allows poachers to walk...'

aS'STAR LEADER: Why we ran photo of Makaburi\xe2\x80\x99s body\n\nYesterday the Star ran a graphic photo of the body of the late Sheikh Makaburi on the front page. \n\nSome readers complained that the photo was too \xe2\x80\x9cgrim\xe2\x80\x9d but we still believe that we were right to run it. \n\nFirstly, the photo had overriding news value. Its publication was not gratuitous. The public was extremely interested. \n\nThere are times when showing dead bodies serves the public interest. \n\nIn recent years we have seen images of Col Gaddafi\xe2\x80\x99s and Saddam Hussein\xe2\x80\x99s bodies. \n\nIn 2010 the Uganda government circulated photos of the severed heads of two suicide bombers in the media. \n\nSecondly, people need to know the truth. Four terrorists were killed at Westgate but we have never seen their bodies. \n\nKenya says the Americans took the bodies, the USA says they are still in Kenya. With this photo we know for certain that Makaburi is dead. \n\nThirdly, sometimes shock is necessary. People should understand that there is a low intensity war at the Coast. \n\nPeople are getting killed on all sides. A photo makes you understand with an immediacy that text can never achieve. \n\nThe Star believes that it did the right thing in putting the photo of Makaburi\xe2\x80\x99s body on the front page.'

For the first time, the Star publishes a report card for the President and his Ministers. We intend to issue an annual report card going forward. This year\xe2\x80\x99s report card shows that, despite a few good performers, Uhuru`s team is at best average and at worst dismal.

aS"RESPONSE BY THE ORANGE DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT TO THE STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KENYA; MARCH 28, 2014:\n *******************************************\n Fellow Kenyans, yesterday, you heard from the President on the state of our nation.\n\n We urge you to spend a few minutes with us as we give our side of the story.\n We are ODM. But it really should not matter because today, we are all hurting. One year after elections, millions of Kenyans are watching and asking; does this government want to stand on our side or in our way.\n Ours is therefore a national call to action on behalf of all the struggling Kenyans. Our main point this morning is; Kenyans deserve far much better than this.\n\n UNITY OF THE NATION:\n\n We are too divided to build a nation ready to confront its challenges.\n\n Jubilee has run the country as a collection of tribes, allies and enemies.\n\n Every appointment to a public position has been handed down as a gift to supporters, along tribal and party lines. This skewed balance of power poses grave danger to our progress and it must not tilt any further in favour of one or two communities. It must be reversed.\n\n ECONOMY AND COST OF LIVING:\n\n Our economy requires urgent, immediate and sustained rethink.\n The absurd policy of tax and spend has traumatised Kenyans.\n\n Families can't pay rent, can't afford food, can't pay school fees and cannot afford bus fare.\n\n In response, we are seeing and hearing the same-old ideology that we've heard before \xe2\x80\x94 over and over again: Salary cuts, retrenchment of workers, cleaning up the payroll of ghost workers and how there will be just a little more pain before it gets better. Kenyans are going through tremendous pain. It must not get worse.\n\n We urge the government to focus on eliminating corruption, inefficiency and wastage. Savings from these areas would be sufficient to finance recovery and growth.\n We advise that the government to put singular focus on food as the biggest driver of cost of living, particularly for the poor.\n\n Let\xe2\x80\x99s focus on pro-poor agricultural investment as this will result in jobs, containing poverty and reduction in cost of living. Let's pay particular attention to job creation, expansion of economic opportunities particularly for farmers, informal sector, and economically disadvantaged communities.\n\n The time has come for the government to treat unemployment as a crisis.\n\n We need a clear road map towards putting millions of Kenyans to work and encouraging companies to hire and not fire people. We have seen no such steps in the last one year.\n Jubilee must use its numerical strength in the Houses of Parliament to come up with administrative, regulatory and legislative measures to help small firms start and expand. The cost of bank loans remains unbelievably high despite so much rhetoric about it. But if we are to create job creators and not job seekers, the cost of loans have to fall. Jubilee must use its numbers to champion these positive measures.\n The government must embrace and engage small contractors and change the way it does business with them. Startups cannot afford to chase payments for months. A simpler engagement would help turn many enterprising young Kenyans into job creators, not job seekers. Small businesses must be treated as the engine of growth, and essential to economic recovery.\n\n CRIME: \n The greatest responsibility of any government is to protect its people and their property. Yet the last one year has brought us a lot of pain and loses. Lives and property have been lost; thousands have been wounded, businesses have underperformed or closed as a result of spiraling crime.\n\n This comes after Kenyans worked so hard in the last ten years to create a largely secure nation. By the time Jubilee took over, we had a largely secure nation in which operating a 24 hour economy looked increasingly realistic, not rhetoric.\n\n Today, criminals hunt us in the streets, from our houses, in churches, in mosques, in matatus and in schools.\n\n We are approaching the first anniversary of the attack on the Westgate Mall. Our hopes and prayers remain with the families that fell victim to this attack. We stand with families who have lost loved ones to criminals across our country. Their pain and horror remain with us.\n\n But as we moan, we are not convinced that the gaps in our security exposed by those attacks have been closed. The Government is saying the right words about the threat we face. But it has failed to take action commensurate with the threat.\n\n When terrorists issue threats and act on them while the government issues threats and fail to track those it is threatening, we know we are on our own as citizens.\n Goods and weapons still enter our borders unnoticed. Fire fighters are still pleading for the tools they need to prevent or respond to an attack.\n\n Poachers have invaded our world famous wildlife heritage with abandon.\n\n Police are still waiting for comprehensive insurance cover even as we ask them to stand in the line of fire on our behalf.\n\n The Government has inexplicably refused to form an inquiry into how the attackers in Westgate got here, even after the president promised this. Yesterday, the National Assembly rejected the report by the National Assembly Security Committee on the attack.\n\n We are therefore calling for the constitution of a Parliamentary Select Committee to investigate the Westgate attack.\n\n We are also calling for a Parliamentary Select Committee to investigate the rising problem of poaching. We suspect there is more to it than meets the eye. In any case, poaching is part and parcel of our growing security, economic and corruption problems.\n\n When a bomb that failed to detonate near the British Airways check-in counter at JKIA late last year, the government shrugged it off as an exploding light-bulb.\n\n After the latest attack in Likoni, the Inspector General of Police considered it beneath him to offer an explanation to Kenyans. He let his juniors deal with it. The President and his deputy did not see this as a matter worth their urgent attention. They addressed it in passing on their way to Tanzania.\n\n These are signs that the government is off track and does not care.\n\n Any discussion of our national security must include recognition and respect for our men and women in uniform.\n\n Whether they are fighting in Somalia or walking our increasingly dangerous streets and borders, we salute them.\n\n These officers and troops have the gratitude of every Kenya for their courage and the sacrifice they are willing to make on our behalf.\n\n But we decry the lack of modern equipment, the absence of opportunities for best training that our officers deserve and their dismal working conditions.\n\n Above all, we ask the government to address the issues of deployments and promotions in the police force, especially now that we are under attack and we are counting on these men and women to be motivated enough to protect us.\n\n Promotions and deployment in the police force is still dogged by tribalism, nepotism and cronyism, not merit.\n\n We must also talk about our military whose prowess we are all too proud of.\n Because of the courage of our military, Somalia is a much better place today. We know that Somalia still has persistent insurgency to deal with. It continues to be a magnet for international terrorists.\n\n But we feel it is time for the Government to present to us a clear plan for ending our presence in Somalia. We are not suggesting that we simply declare the job done and pull out. We are not suggesting we sneak out through the back door.\n\n We want a clear plan for transferring responsibility for Somalia's security to the Somalis. We believe training the Somali forces to take charge must be expedited. We must accelerate Somalia\xe2\x80\x99s economic development, particularly through infrastructure that gives Somalis a stake in achieving a better future.\n\n We must also intensify regional and international diplomacy that will deny fuel to the anti-western sentiments that power insurgency in Somalia.\n\n We want the government to table before Kenyans a comprehensive plan to protect the nation from terrorism. We have only heard promises and more threats.\n\n We want to see the government's plan to build a military, a police force and an intelligence gathering system that will be second to none. Kenyans are dying because we lack ability to collect timely and reliable intelligence to keep us safe at home.\n\n EDUCATION:\n Even as the government proceeds with the ill-conceived laptops project, we are yet to address the issue of cost of education.\n\n It is now more than ten years since fees were abolished in public schools. But we know fees exist and are keeping many children out of school. Parents buy uniforms, text books, desks, school buses, pay motivation fees, and much more. We feel the government must climb the education tree from the bottom. Is education free or not? If it is, why are these many levies being imposed and when will they stop?\n\n We continue to caution the government against the extravagant laptops project. It is not realistic. It is not sustainable and it is not a priority. We support IT in learning and we laud the government for championing it. But we advocate for computer labs in all schools instead of laptops for every child at this stage.\n\n The cost and built in room for corruption in the acquisition of laptops aside, a bigger question is whether the laptops will actually improve learning. Will reading skills improve because the children have laptops instead of text books? Will children perform better in math and science? Will parents afford the cost of repairs and maintenance? Who will replace crashed or lost and stolen laptops?\n\n CORRUPTION:\n\n We are concerned about the corruption roulette in government, which Jubilee calls war on corruption. The government admits that thieves have invaded no higher place than the Office of the President.\n\n But to date, there have been no sackings, no prosecutions, no naming of names. We have been treated to the drama of members of government publicly campaigning for a chance to fix contracts for grand infrastructure projects in return for bribes.\n\n As we pay lip service and issue warnings at rallies and church functions, corruption is eating into government coffers, paying ghost workers and paying for services not rendered or way above market rates.\n\n Yet today, the battle on wages is rated much more urgent by the Jubilee government than the war against corruption. The Jubilee government has now resolved to pay the so-called Anglo-Leasing debts, an outright conduit for corrupt deals. Warnings have run their course. We need action.\n\n RULE OF LAW:\n We must protect the Constitution and its promises. We must safeguard the rule of law, the media and civil liberties. All these are threatened today. Judges have been called names. Laws have been signed to curb the free media. There have been attempts to limit foreign funding for NGOs.\n\n Jubilee government has failed to discontinue extrajudicial killings thus undermining the right to life. As we speak, there is an arbitrary shoot-to-kill order against terrorists as well as other criminals. The country has seen an alarming rise in religious intolerance and religious bigotry which the government has not in any way attempted to manage.\n\n OUR PLEDGE:\n One year of Jubilee Government has landed us in very uncertain times. How long they times last depends on the government. We want to assure Kenyans that when we believe the Government is on the right track, we will not allow partisan interests stand in the way of what's good for the country. We will be first in line to work with the Government. As at now, we repeat; a Government can do better. Kenyans deserve better.\n\n We are losing patience with politics of tribalism, nepotism, favoritism, cronyism and rule by fiat. We are tired of incompetence and dishonesty in government.\n\n HON PROF. ANYANG NYONGO\n Ag. PARTY LEADER\n ODM.\n MARCH 28, 2014."

We are faced with a resurgent extremist movement that has set out to divide us against ourselves. But we refuse to fall for its lies. We know that the war we are fighting is not a war of religions. It is not a clash of cultures. It is a fight against a small and vicious set of deluded criminals. A central element of our tolerance is the work of institutions such as the Vincentian Fathers. In keeping with the vision of St Vincent de Paul, whose mission to the poor is universal: they are not bound by tribe, tongue, or nation; their work stretches across the world. They are not even bound by religion, because, since its founding in India, they have reached out to all God\xe2\x80\x99s children, whether Muslim or Hindu, Sikh or Protestant.

The roads will be built by Oasis Group International\nfrom the US in the 8 constituencies.\n\nHomabay County has some of the most marginalised areas in Kenya by the he past regimes. Some consituencies in Homabay have never had an inc tarmac road since independence despite first maping and road designs done by Kenyatta Government in the 70s.-They just remained as plans. Never mind that 60% of Kenyas multi billion fish revenue  comes from the shores of Homabay County.\n\nThanks govenor Awiti'

aS'HOW THE PEOPLES PRESIDENT WON PRAISE OF KIKUYUS\n\nWhen a Facebook flier announcing that former Prime Minister Raila Odinga would attend a service at St Stephens Church in Lowell, Massachusetts was circulated early last week, many people who saw it were piqued.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I saw the post on Facebook, I doubted, \xe2\x80\x98Agwambo at St Stephens?, that to me was not for real,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Muthui Mwangi, a Kenyan living in Chelmsford, Massachusetts.\nMr Mwangi doubted because the area is mainly populated by members of the Kikuyu community, who attend St Stephens Church.\nThen there were those who believed that Mr Odinga\xe2\x80\x99s real intentions to attend a service at the church were anything but to pray. It was easy to understand this apprehension given the chasm that exists between people from the Luo community and those from the Kikuyu when it comes to politics.\nThere are two regions in the US that are predominantly Kikuyu. Boston, especially the cities of Worcester and Lowell. Then there is the Atlanta area especially Marietta. Social functions in these places appear, feel and sound more like they are taking place in either Murang\xe2\x80\x99a or Nyeri. For instance, children born in the US to Kenyan parents in Lowell sing in near perfect Kikuyu.\nTherefore, it was no surprise based on the interviews the Sunday Nation conducted among residents of Lowell the day before the church service that few people knew how Mr Odinga would be received if he showed up at the church despite the fact that he a respected opposition political leader and a former Prime Minister.\nBriefing the Sunday Nation in his office on Saturday, Pastor Kimohu acknowledged the tensions that had enveloped the area before Mr Odinga\xe2\x80\x99s visit. The pastor booked a banquet room in one of the biggest hotels in the area for the former PM to interact with Kenyans after the service over a meal.\nIt is against this background that the former PM walked into St Stephens Church Sunday morning, unannounced and unnoticed by the congregation, in the company of just three people \xe2\x80\x94 his personal assistant in the US, Mr George Osewe, his friend Mr Sammy Maina and his wife. He strode in casually in the middle of a praise and worship session, took his position in the front row and started dancing along to a Kikuyu praise and worship song.\nCameras swung\nIt is when the cameras swung and focused on him that people noticed he had arrived. Highly talented gospel recording artiste Esther Ndirangu commonly known as Queen Essy who was among the praise and worship group on stage, took the lead microphone, gave the band a thumbs up cue and seamlessly transitioned from the Kikuyu song to Kiswahili. Soon the sanctuary that was half-full suddenly filled up and the mood changed. Everyone was suddenly sucked into a praise and worship mood that many described as inspirational.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter that, I think the Holy Spirit completely took over. I could see everybody including the former PM dancing and transported to a higher ground and I knew there and then that there is no politics in the Kingdom of God. To Him be the glory,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms Ndirangu said after the service.\nWhen Pastor Kimohu rose to pray after the singing, he heaped praise on the former PM for his humility and reconciliatory approach to matters, saying leadership came from God and once a leader, one would always remain a leader.\nThe picture of the former PM standing on stage holding a young girl in his arms as the congregation prayed for the children is an image many people will remember for a long time to come.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat time when the PM stood there with children all around him looking excited and patiently taking pictures with them is a moment you wish could freeze in time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sammy Maina, a worshipper,\nAt the end of the service, worshippers listened to his message of reconciliation that lasted exactly 40 minutes. They realised the former PM was a warm person whose visit meant no harm.'

aS'THE CHURCH IS DIVIDED IN DENOMINATIONS\n\nTHE GREAT CITY RELIGIOSITY, THE SIN OF ISRAEL AND SONS OF JACOB\n\nThe CATHOLIC church is insulting me, that when I begun the LABAMBA business I had a lot of money, literally what they say is that now I do not have money since I got saved, an OLD lady friend told me so. \n\nA guy also met me yesterday and challenged me that if I just give him the business without taking him to court he can be a millionaire in just a few days. He told me that there is something wrong with me, because I left my God. I wonder how silly man can be since Yheshua (Jesus) did not leave any church denomination and if you tell them we share and reason they do not have time and you are too dip. So making money is the blessing as this guy was telling me how he is blessed to be working with good groups over weekends.\n\nNO WONDER I AM NOT PROGRESSING FOR CHURCH IS INSULTING GODS MESSENGER. FOR SURE NOW IT COMES OUT THAT THEY PLOT AGAINST ME AND THEY MEAN TO BRING MY DOWNFALL NOT SUCCESS IN TERMS OF CERTAIN CHURCHES AND DENOMINATIONS...\n\nLET THEM THOSE WHO ARE INCENSED NOT RECEIVE MY REST, FOR I GAVE UP SEX, I GAVE UP MONEY, I GAVE UP A GOOD LIFE FOR THEM. I AM SACRIFICING MY LIFE BECAUSE OF THEM MY PEOPLE, FOR THE WHOLE CHURCH...\n\nSO MY MUMS FRIENDS STOPPED ME THE OTHER DAY IN OUTERING TO WEARY ME OUT IT WAS SOMETHING PLANNED BY MY OWN BIOLOGICAL MUM AND HER FRIENDS, AND THEY WERE TRYING ME OUT AND TESTING ME MOCKING ME! SO NOW I HAVE A CLEAR REASON AS TO WHY I DIFFER WITH MY MUM, FOR THEY THINK ME WRONG AND THEY HAVE TAKEN THE PLACE OF MY GOD STANDING BEFORE ME AS SATAN BECAUSE IT IS WRITTEN:\n\nThe Fall of Lucifer\n\n12 \xe2\x80\x9cHow you are fallen from heaven,\nO Lucifer,[a] son of the morning!\nHow you are cut down to the ground,\nYou who weakened the nations!\n13 For you have said in your heart:\n\xe2\x80\x98I will ascend into heaven,\nI will exalt my throne above the stars of God;\nI will also sit on the mount of the congregation\nOn the farthest sides of the north;\n14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds,\nI will be like the Most High.\xe2\x80\x99\n15 Yet you shall be brought down to Sheol,\nTo the lowest depths of the Pit.\n\n16 \xe2\x80\x9cThose who see you will gaze at you,\nAnd consider you, saying:\n\xe2\x80\x98Is this the man who made the earth tremble,\nWho shook kingdoms,\n17 Who made the world as a wilderness\nAnd destroyed its cities,\nWho did not open the house of his prisoners?\xe2\x80\x99\nIsaiah 14:12-17.\n\nI WILL BE LIKE THE MOST HIGH SAYS SATAN AND SATAN AROUSES HER ANGELS AGAINST THE ANGEL OF THE LORD. AND THEY SEAL ALL DOORS AND SAY THE ANGEL IS THE DEVIL SO LET THEM RULE FOR A WHILE. MY FIRST TRUE LOVE MARIAH WAS THIS LADY FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, AND HER SISTER IS THE ONE THAT APPROACHED ME A KAMBA VITE. OH SHE BRINGS SO MANY MEMORIES BACK, TO SAY THE TRUTH I WAS IN LOVE WITH HER THAN MY GIRLFRIEND MARIAH, BECAUSE VERO ALWAYS WAS CONCERNED OF ME AND SHE ATTENDED TO ME ALWAYS MENTALLY. YES VERO IS THE STRONG WOMAN THAT I WOULD HAVE WANTED BUT I WENT FOR THE PRETTIER AND A FOOLISH MISTAKE I MADE...\n\nWHAT A FOOL I WAS BUT ALSO I SAW VERO AFTER I FELL IN LOVE WITH MARIAH, AND I THOUGHT THAT VERO IS BOASTFUL UNTIL WE STARTED COMMUNICATING. THEN I DISCOVERED THAT MARIAH IS JUST A FOOLISH BEAUTY AND WORTHLESS WHO DOES NOT CARE AND SHE MOCKED HER MAN, BUT VERO CRIED FOR ME. LET VERO BE BLESSED AND PROSPER FOR HER BEING CONCERNED AND TO LISTEN TO MEN WITHOUT ANY INTENTION...\n\nBY THE WAY I HAD NO MONEY LIKE I HAVE NOW, BUT I GIVE IT UP ALL FOR THE PURPOSE OF GIVING A GOOD EXAMPLE. BESIDES MY VISION IS BIGGER THAN MONEY AND WHATEVER I DO IS ALWAYS A CERTAIN LESSON. \n\nIF PEOPLE WOULD JUST SIT BACK AND ASK SOMEONE WHY, THEN THEY COULD FIND MANY ANSWERS AND NOT JUDGE A BROTHER OR SISTER. THE GUY WHO JUDGED ME TOO IS A KAMBA I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS WITH KAOS...'

But still, Raila has one last chance to endear himself to Kenyans who will be disgruntled by the Jubilee govt but the Problem might be Kalonzo who might not accept to deputise anyone cos age and political circumstances are also against him too. I tend to think Jubilee will make a killer attack, backed by billions of shillings on CORD strong holds and especially Ukambani region. I foresee a situation where TNA will cut a political deal with WIPER party and other Western Kenyan Parties. The devil is will more likely be in the 2022 elections when TNA will be needing to pay Wiper or someone back. I do not know about TNA/ UPR relations in this whole scenario but I doubt if its that strong or even real. I think Ruto has made too many enemies in his political history to be elected or win or inherit from Uhuru the presidency in 2022. That brings us to two main names. Dr Alfred Nganga Mutua and another Dr Evans Odhiambo Kidero... and dont dismiss one Mike 'Gedion' Mbuvi, alias Sonko too! ...  Its only my opinion... Dont take it too serious."

If\r\nyou have nothing to offer your\r\ncitizens in terms of development,\r\nkeep them busy with an invented\r\nenemy! 70% lack running water!\r\n60% poverty,\r\nLessons from #Eastleigh: It's all\r\nabout the money. Even if you have\r\nan ID or mandate it can get taken\r\naway, then you have to pay bribe.\r\nA war on terror cannot be won by\r\nraping Kenyan Somali girls in their\r\nhomes while soliciting bribes from\r\ntheir men,The suffering of Somalis\r\nwas indiscriminate, it does not\r\nknow refugees from citizens and\r\nGarissa from Mandera\xe2\x80\x9dTo Fight Al-\r\nShabab you need to engage and\r\nget the people on your side not to\r\nkill and torture them, that is not\r\ncreating security but animosity!\r\nThe media might be silent about\r\nthe #Kasaraniconcentrationcamp\r\nbut truth will some day come out.\r\nIt is unrealistic that leaders on\r\ntrial at the ICC accused of killing\r\ntheir own citizens can be trusted\r\nto protect the same citizens.\r\nKenya police has never solved any\r\nhigh profile murder or\r\nassassination since independence!\r\nGreat reputation right? Majority of\r\nKenyan-Somalis are orphans,\r\nwidowers, some still suffering\r\nfrom damages and fear Alshabaab\r\ndid to them back in Somalia.\r\nCan any-one Pinpoint who actually\r\nthrew the grenades? Is it Somalis?\r\nThe Muslims? The people Of\r\nEastleigh? The women being\r\nabused? The young kids?, Does\r\nKenya security have any Links,\r\nIntelligence, any pictures of\r\ncriminals? What operation is this?\r\nWhat do you think Kenyans of\r\nSomalia origin solders serving in\r\nSomalia as KDF under # Amison\r\nfeels, seeing government mistreat\r\ntheir relatives back at home?.\r\nAs per the way things are now in\r\nthe so called Operation Usalama\r\nWatch There is a overwhelming\r\npopular support by Kenyans on\r\nVictimisation of Somalis, one thing\r\nthey are forgetting after Somalis\r\nWho is next??\r\nThat question will be answered by\r\nH.E.
