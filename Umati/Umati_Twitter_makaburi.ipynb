Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said the court was withdrawing all its charges against Muthaura as they did not have compelling evidence to prosecute his case to the end. However, Bensouda stressed that the cases against co- accused, President elect Uhuru would continue as the prosecution had fresh evidence against him.  But Bensouda also accused the Kenya government of failing to fully co-operate with the court in its investigations. http://ow.ly/iL5PS</td>\n",

And like a mindless robot, you do it with relish and dedication. In 2007, Kikuyus were made to believe they were enemies with the Kalenjin. They attacked each other with vengeance. 2013, they were told they were friends for the next 5 years. They are falling over each other to show love and brotherhood.\\n\\nIn 2007, Luos and Kalenjins were ordered by the political gods to be friends. They worked miracles pulling together as brothers. in 2013, they were ordered to be enemies. They are now best of the enemies tearing each other.\\n\\nDear mindless Kenyan robots, as you hate your brother here in 2013 to please your political gods, be careful...you will be in a awkward position in 2017! You don't know who your political gods (politicians) will chose for you as your friend or enemy for the next 5 years in 2017!!!!\\n\\nvia Kenny Kaburu</td>\n",

So far there is no hope for you. You would have taken Murang'a far as you have done with your former constituency. All is not lost though, you have 10 good years to pull up better though Andrew would stand a better chance next time. All the best. </td>\n",

But this is the truth: Ethnicity only becomes important in politics. Today I ate a delicious bowl of salad near Embassy House. It never occurred to me the ethnicity of the wonderful ladies who served me. I travelled in a Matatu to Ongata Rongai early morning. I never asked the driver, conductor which tribe they belonged to. Your favourite doctor, mama mboga, mama samaki, carpenter could be from the 'other' Coalition or ethnic group but you have never thought about it. Are there lifts, markets, hospitals, matatus for tribe x or coalition y? Kenyans, lets be real and maintain our true self as we do every other day. Let politics not divide us so badly such that we 'place' people based on the first letters of their names. God bless Kenya.</td>\n",

And like a mindless robot, you do it with relish and dedication. In 2007, Kikuyus were made to believe they were enemies with the Kalenjin. They attacked each other with vengeance. 2013, they were told they were friends for the next 5 years. They are falling over each other to show love and brotherhood.\\n\\nIn 2007, Luos and Kalenjins were ordered by the political gods to be friends. They worked miracles pulling together as brothers. in 2013, they were ordered to be enemies. They are now best of the enemies tearing each other.\\n\\nDear mindless Kenyan robots, as you hate your brother here in 2013 to please your political gods, be careful...you will be in a awkward position in 2017! You don't know who your political gods (politicians) will chose for you as your friend or enemy for the next 5 years in 2017!!!!\\n\\nvia Kenny Kaburu   \n",

Crucial and detailed news or info are on the print media which is so costly to the commonman. In my village, newspapers are affordable a week after. We need to know of new regional developments to appreciate each other and be one.\\n\\nKenyans should stop tribalising leadership, its an old age culture.

But this is the truth: Ethnicity only becomes important in politics. Today I ate a delicious bowl of salad near Embassy House. It never occurred to me the ethnicity of the wonderful ladies who served me. I travelled in a Matatu to Ongata Rongai early morning. I never asked the driver, conductor which tribe they belonged to. Your favourite doctor, mama mboga, mama samaki, carpenter could be from the 'other' Coalition or ethnic group but you have never thought about it. Are there lifts, markets, hospitals, matatus for tribe x or coalition y? Kenyans, lets be real and maintain our true self as we do every other day. Let politics not divide us so badly such that we 'place' people based on the first letters of their names. God bless Kenya.   \n",

The utterances by the petitioner demonstrate beyond peradventure that he would only consider an election free, fair and democratic if he were declared the winner. I urge this Honourable Court to protect this nation by rejecting this irresponsible and unlawful attempt to secure power notwithstanding there sounding loss suffered at the General Elections.   \n",

Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said the court was withdrawing all its charges against Muthaura as they did not have compelling evidence to prosecute his case to the end. However, Bensouda stressed that the cases against co- accused, President elect Uhuru would continue as the prosecution had fresh evidence against him.  But Bensouda also accused the Kenya government of failing to fully co-operate with the court in its investigations. http://ow.ly/iL5PS  \n",

So far there is no hope for you. You would have taken Murang'a far as you have done with your former constituency. All is not lost though, you have 10 good years to pull up better though Andrew would stand a better chance next time. All the best.   \n",
